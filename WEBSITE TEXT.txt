WEBSITE TEXT

The art of language is very beautiful, some arguably more beautiful than others.
In English you would say Hello, Spanish would say Hola, Japanese would say Kon’nichiwa. As a developer I would like to say “<p>Hello Friend</p>” and welcome to my life and journey with code.
The language of code is something I find very fascinating. As we can see throughout the world, the gravitation towards technology driven solutions is on a permanent rise. Code is the language of our future.
From solving picture puzzles as a kid to building complex tech driven solutions to problems, I would say I’ve always been about problem-solving.

ABOUT PAGE TEXT	

At an early age I had a passion for automating tasks and creating tech driven solutions to real life problems.
From creating bash scripts in notepad for copying and moving folder content on my desktop, to creating applicable and responsive web apps for the world to use. I pursued a year in a CS degree program at the University of Lethbridge where I picked up the concept of algorithms and applying these bodies of logic to understand how AI was modelled. I transferred to CyberSecurity at the Southern Albera Institute of Technology. Through applying the principles of Confidentiality, Authenticity and Integrity I was able to securely implement user applications. As I progressed in my development journey, I found a peculiar passion for Web App Development with a deep appreciation for the role it has played in building up the world we live in. Notable mentions include; Facebook which reinvented the social parameters which has become the day to day standard, YouTube which encapsulated and preserved media cultures into a technological form and Shopify which launched the retail and corporative space online giving the sector a unique opportunity at a vast consumer base.
